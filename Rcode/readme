This is code that I used during my Masters project: The code returns the optimal route to traverse all of the Wainwrights in the Lake district
Travelling salesman problems have been attempting many times, and very efficient algorirthms now exist, but they require a cost matrix as an input
Producing a cost matrix is the real challenge of this problem as you have to account for vertical movement, and the terrain.

inputs: sattellite raster, height raster, river map, footpath map, peak locations map, buildings map

1. creates a friction map 
2. path finds via Dijkras between height and friction (uses GRASS, externally ran from R)
3. creates a cost matrix 
4. solves using concorde 
5. produces route
