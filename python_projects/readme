These are the python projects I've been working on since 05/2020 - 07/2020:
Note that if you want to get some of these working you will have to make some changes:
to get the sql programs working you will have to set up your own sql database as you dont have my username and password for obvious reasons
to get platform zeros wokring you will need to create your own account for realtimetrains.api 
to get the email notifier/texter working you will have to set up your own twilio account
to get poker working you need to make a local AND onedrive directory containing all 52 poker cards as .jpg files
